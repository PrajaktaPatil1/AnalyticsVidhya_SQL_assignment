# Create a Library Management System. Following are the outputs we expect from you:

1) Think about the tables we will need to run a library.
2) Figure out the cases like issuing a book, returning a book, checking the fine due etc. Basically you need to think  about all the operations which we do in a library and then write down the queries to execute them.
